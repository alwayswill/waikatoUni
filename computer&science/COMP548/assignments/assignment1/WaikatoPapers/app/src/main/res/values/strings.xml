                This paper will consider the design and implementation of applications for mobile devices covering topics such as: mobile application software architectures; development platform options; design and evaluation of small-screen touch-based user interfaces; leveraging technologies such as global positioning, near-field communication and orientation/environmental sensing; mobile web applications. Practical work will use the Android platform and so the paper is best-suited to students with experience of Java programming.\n
